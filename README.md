# Realtek ASIO Driver

This project provides a standalone installer for the official Realtek ASIO driver, extracted from a larger driver package. This is intended to simplify the installation process for users who need the ASIO driver without the full package.

## About

The Realtek ASIO driver is essential for users engaged in audio production and editing, offering low-latency performance. This repository does **not** modify or own the original files; it only hosts the ASIO driver separately for convenience. The driver was originally distributed by Realtek through OEMs like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Asus.

## Updates

I am not able to update the driver files themselves since they are managed by Realtek. However, if an updated version is released, I will include it in this repository. Please check back periodically or contribute updates if you find new versions.

## Contributing

If you come across a newer version of the Realtek ASIO driver, please let me know by opening an issue in the **[Issues tab](https://github.com/samuelcaldas/Realtek-ASIO-Driver/issues)**. Contributions are welcome to help keep this project up-to-date.

## Disclaimer

This project is **not** affiliated with Realtek or any OEMs like Dell, HP, Lenovo, or Asus. The original driver files are the property of Realtek, and this repository is simply a repackaging for user convenience. Use at your own risk.
